macos_hidden_ls - build MacOS ls that skips hidden files
========================================================

This repository contains a build script and patch that modifies the open
source `ls` program for MacOS published by Apple so that it skips showing
files or directories marked with the hidden flag (as per `chflags(1)`).

Getting Started
---------------

To build from scatch:

    $ ./build_ls.sh

This will check out the appropriate source files in the `src` directory, and
leave a build artifact in `src/file_cmds/ls/ls`. To test if it works, you can
do something like this:

    $ echo normal > normal.txt
    $ echo hidden > hidden.txt
    $ /bin/ls
    $ src/file_cmds/ls/ls
    $ chflags hidden hidden.txt
    $ /bin/ls
    $ src/file_cmds/ls/ls

Description
-----------

Normally files and directories with the hidden flag are hidden from the GUI,
but remain visible via command line `ls`. With this patch, hidden files and
directories are treated the same as files and directories whose names begin
with a dot: they are not shown unless the `-a` flag is passed.

Apple publishes source code for BSD userland system utilities such as `ls`.
However, bilding them on with modern MacOS and Xcode requires some tweaks to
the build process, and to arrange for header files to be found. The script
in this repository automates fetching, patching, and building `ls`. It is
tested on MacOS Monterey (12.1) with Xcode 13.2.1, recent as of Q1 2022.

The patch this script writes makes the following changes:

* Add header search paths for the various source dependencies
* Update obsolete SDK name
* Fix updated header path names
* Patch `ls` to treat the hidden files similarly to dot files

The script leaves the patch file and a build.sh file in the `src/file_cmds`
directory, which can then be used to iterate on and rebuild the code if you
have a different change you wish to make. Regenerate a new patch file with a
command like the following:

    git diff --no-prefix -p | sed 's|'$(cd .. && pwd)'|__ROOTDIR__|'

The script fetches Git repositories into the current working directory.
The script is not repeatable; if you run it multiple times, it will try
to patch the files in `src/file_cmd` twice, and probably fail.
